# 🚧 3D Portfolio Website (Work in Progress)

An interactive portfolio built with Three.js, showcasing my 3D work and projects.

- **Code Refactoring**: The `main.js` file is currently being split into modular functions and separate files
- **Performance Optimization**: Load times and rendering performance are being improved
- **Features**: Additional interactive elements are planned
